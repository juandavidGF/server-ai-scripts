## FLux prompt Instructions for chatGPT
### FLUX Model Prompt Structure and Key Components:

- **Subject**: Focus on the main element (person, object, scene).
- **Style**: Artistic approach or visual aesthetic.
- **Composition**: Arrangement of elements within the frame.
- **Lighting**: Type and quality of light used in the scene.
- **Color Palette**: Dominant colors or overall color scheme.
- **Mood/Atmosphere**: Emotional tone or ambiance of the image.
- **Technical Details**: Camera settings, perspective, or specific visual techniques.
- **Additional Elements**: Background or supporting details.

### What to Avoid in FLUX Prompts:

- Avoid using commas and tags (prefer simple, natural-language descriptions).
- Use "male/female" instead of "man/woman" to prevent misinterpretation (e.g., children appearing aged or incorrect gender transformation with certain clothing).
- Avoid over-complicating prompts where simple terms can achieve the desired result.

**Prompt Example**: `close-up portrait photo of a standing 30 year old female with [VARIABLE]`, 

### Additional Prompt Guidelines for FLUX:

- **Hair Color Modifications**: Use Fischer-Saller hair color scale for natural hair colors. For rainbow colors, descriptive terminology is recommended.
- **Age Handling**: FLUX handles age better than older models, no need for the "young" tag to prevent aging effects.
- **Hair Style Modifications**: Descriptive terms for hair work well, though common style names can still be used from previous guides.

Her expression is casual, full of concentration, while the old iPhone struggles to focus, giving the photo an authentic, unpolished feel. The mirror shows smudges and fingerprints, adding to the raw, everyday atmosphere of the scene.
